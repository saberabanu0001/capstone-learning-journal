# Well midtern presentation(semi workshop) is over. My team didn't do well. My part was working very well, but unfortunately the wheel was not at all working.

# My friends who were handling the speech+movement part, checked that it is working like move front, back, left, right. But in the presentation day, all parts were connected(camera, speaker, microphone, monitor to run the codes), problem started!

# Monitor took 8GB out of our 16GB Jetson nano. Other parts was working well separately, but wheel was not moveing along with command.

## I was very sad for 1 day after the presentation. I was feeling like we couldn't show any progress. Not at all focusing to studies.

## Anyway got A0 mark, but feeling shame for this marks, because we don't deserve this. 
# It's true that we did too much effort, whole night work, fixing things again and again. Also this is all of our first time working with embaddeds system. Basically me, I never worked with any hardware, I dn't have interest too! but now! I feel too much interest to this project.

# Anyway, talked with other team members, they are sad too!

## Hoping for the final.

**Anyway, Sabera, don't give hope!!**
**Sabera is brave!**
