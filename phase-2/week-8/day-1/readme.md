# ðŸ§¾ Vision & Voice System for Capstone Robot
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This module is part of the Capstone Robot Project developed at Sejong University.
It integrates real-time computer vision and voice feedback using an OAK-D Lite AI camera and DepthAI SDK, designed to give the robot spatial awareness and vocal interaction capability.

**Over the past two days, we built and tested:**

- A real-time object detection system (YOLOv8n Spatial Detection Network).

- A macOS-compatible voice alert system that speaks detected objects aloud.

- A modular DepthAI pipeline compatible with SLAM and future motion systems.
