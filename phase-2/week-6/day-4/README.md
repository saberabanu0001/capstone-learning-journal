ðŸ“˜ Week 6 â€“ Day 3: OAK-D Lite Deployment Research on Jetson NX
ðŸ”¹ Objective

To study and understand the process of deploying the OAK-D Lite vision system on the Jetson NX platform using Luxonis documentation.

ðŸ”¹ What I Learned

Explored Luxonis documentation on Jetson integration:

Deploy to Jetson Guide

Main Luxonis Documentation

Understood the hardware connection between Jetson NX and OAK-D Lite (USB 3.0 interface, power requirements, and setup).

Learned how to install DepthAI SDK on Jetson using pip or Docker.

Studied the deployment workflow, from initializing the DepthAI pipeline to running YOLO-based spatial detection models.

Reviewed how to verify successful camera connection and test the first DepthAI script.

Prepared to run the real-hardware pipeline once OAK-D arrives.

ðŸ”¹ Next Steps

Connect the OAK-D Lite to the Jetson NX and test camera detection.

Run the DepthAI example script to confirm proper setup.

Begin integrating the actual detection pipeline with live camera data.
