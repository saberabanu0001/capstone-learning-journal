1. The Robotics Development Process and My Role
Initially, I was confused about the overall robotics development process and how my vision part would fit into it. We've established that the project is broken down into several key phases:

Mechanical Design: Building the robot's physical structure.

Electronics & Wiring: Connecting the sensors and the computer to the power source.

Software Development & Integration: Writing the code that makes the robot function (this is my main role).

System Testing: Ensuring all parts work together correctly.

My specific task is to develop the Smart Perception pillar. This system will enable the robot to "see" its surroundings using a 3D camera, recognize faces, and avoid obstacles. My code will be the "eyes" that feed information to the robot's "brain" (the Jetson Orin).

2. Hardware: MacBook vs. Jetson Orin
My lack of hardware experience made me unsure about the roles of the MacBook and the Jetson Orin. We clarified that:

MacBook M4: This is my development tool. I will write and test my code on this powerful laptop, connecting the 3D camera via a USB cable. The MacBook's robust interface and processing power are ideal for the initial coding and debugging phases.

NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX (16GB): This will be the robot's permanent brain. Once my code is fully functional, I will deploy it to the Jetson. The robot will then run autonomously, powered by the Jetson, without needing my MacBook.

3. Required Skills and Learning Plan
With 1-2 weeks before the hardware arrives, I need to start learning OpenCV, which is essential for my role. My key tasks will be:

Acquiring data from the 3D camera.

Implementing obstacle detection.

Developing person recognition and tracking features.

Building a room map using VSLAM.

To track my progress, I will upload my daily work to GitHub using a structured folder system:
