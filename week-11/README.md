# well, now I'm planning to use LLAVA with LLAMA cpp.

## But here are the clarification of the things -

## 🧠 How LLaVA and llama.cpp are connected

### 👉 1. LLaVA is a MODEL

- It is NOT a program.
- It is NOT software.
- It is NOT a repository that runs by itself.

- - LLaVA = a trained vision-language model
- - (Weights + training recipe)
